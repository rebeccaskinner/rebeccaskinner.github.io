            <h1>Resume</h1>
            <h2 id="about-me">About Me</h2>
<p>I’ve been writing software professionally since 2006. Throughout my career I have worked across a number of languages, tech stacks, and business domains, as well as in several different roles. I do my best work as a hands-on technical leader and mentor where I can balance my time between solving important technical challenges with helping other members of my team grown in their own roles.</p>
<p>Technically speaking, I enjoy working with functional languages, especially haskell, and with lower level languages like C, Rust, and assembly. I’ve also spent a fair bit of time writing Go, Python, and Ruby. I like Nix, and I prefer to work with Linux as both a development platform and a deployment target. I enjoy thinking about things like security, networking, distributed systems, and how to build better abstractions over complex architectures and business domains.</p>
<h2 id="some-work-ive-done">Some Work I’ve done</h2>
<p>I’m currently writing an introductory through intermediate level book on industrial haskell programming, <em>Effective Haskell</em> for <a href="https://pragprog.com/">Pragmatic Bookshelf</a>. It should be available for early access in Q3 2021. I’m also currently serving a term on the <a href="https://www.haskell.org/haskell-org-committee/">Haskell.org Committee</a>, and I volunteer on the community track for the <a href="https://haskell.foundation">Haskell Foundation</a>.</p>
<p>Some of my career highlights include:</p>
<ul>
<li>My current role as a haskell engineer at <a href="https://mercury.com/">Mercury</a> helping build amazing banking experiences for startups</li>
<li>Working as a Principle AI Engineer at Target, helping to ensure efficient operation of the supply chain during the COVID-19 pandemic and quarantine related supply chain crisis.</li>
<li>Co-Founding Untwyne, Inc. where we sought to allow businesses and individuals to make the most of their own data.</li>
<li>Designing and leading implementation work on a cybersecurity simulation and training platform at EADS North America and Camber</li>
</ul>
