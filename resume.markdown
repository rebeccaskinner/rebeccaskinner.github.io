## About Me

I've been writing software professionally since 2006. Throughout my career I
have worked across a number of languages, tech stacks, and business
domains, as well as in several different roles. I do my best work as a hands-on
technical leader and mentor where I can balance my time between solving
important technical challenges with helping other members of my team grown in
their own roles.

Technically speaking, I enjoy working with functional languages, especially
haskell, and with lower level languages like C, Rust, and assembly. I've also
spent a fair bit of time writing Go, Python, and Ruby. I like Nix, and I prefer
to work with Linux as both a development platform and a deployment target. I
enjoy thinking about things like security, networking, distributed systems, and
how to build better abstractions over complex architectures and business
domains.

## Some Work I've done

I'm currently writing an introductory through intermediate level book on
industrial haskell programming, _Effective Haskell_ for
[Pragmatic Bookshelf](https://pragprog.com/).
It should be available for early access in Q3
2021. I'm also currently serving a term on the
[Haskell.org Committee](https://www.haskell.org/haskell-org-committee/), and I
volunteer on the community track for the
[Haskell Foundation](https://haskell.foundation).

Some of my career highlights include:

- My current role as a haskell engineer at [Mercury](https://mercury.com/)
  helping build amazing banking experiences for startups
- Working as a Principle AI Engineer at Target, helping to ensure efficient
  operation of the supply chain during the COVID-19 pandemic and quarantine
  related supply chain crisis.
- Co-Founding Untwyne, Inc. where we sought to allow businesses and
  individuals to make the most of their own data.
- Designing and leading implementation work on a cybersecurity simulation and
  training platform at EADS North America and Camber
